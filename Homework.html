        <p>Geography has 3 branches one being physical geography talking about the actual earth and environment
            by itself. Another one is human geography which studies humans on where and how they live and settle
            and make industrys. And the last one is environmental geography which mixes both of human and physical
            geography. Geographers around the world get many job oppurtunites such as biologist, weather forecaster,
            city planner and many more!
